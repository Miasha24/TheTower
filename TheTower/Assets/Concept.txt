Help defend your magic cauldron!

Monsters, spirits, and more are trying to steal it for its power.

Create a chaotic brew to ward off the attackers!

Each wave you get the opportunity to choose 1 upgrade.

These upgrades vary wildly, but will all help defend the cauldron.

The chance for different upgrades to show are based on their rarity.

The upgrades have different rarities: Common, rare, legendary.
